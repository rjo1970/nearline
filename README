== Synopsis
Nearline is a near-line backup and recovery solution.

It is a compelling replacement for straight-to-tape or
straight-to-disc backup solutions.

It employs a simple database schema to store the data
and prevent redundancy in the backup stream.

== Examples

=== Backup
    Nearline.connect! 'backup' # Creates the schema, if needed
    files_to_back_up = ['/home/rj']
    things_to_skip = ['\\.class$', '/temp/']
    Nearline.backup('my_laptop', files_to_back_up, things_to_skip)

=== Restore (Easy and painless from irb)
    Nearline.connect 'backup'
    Nearline.restore 'my_laptop'

== API
